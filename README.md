# Sparse Factorization of Large Square Matrices

## Install requirements.txt

## Non-parametric experiments
To run the code you should:
1. Download the directory "non-parametric";
2. Extract Square_matrices;
3. run sf_appr_test_all.m in Matlab.

Explaination of the files we use in this part:
1. chord_mask_mat.m is used to generate chord masking for W;
2. data_list.csv is a list used to go though all the pictures;
3. load_suqare_matrix.m is a dataloader used to transform images to matrices;
4. sf_appr_test.m is the sparse approximation for one instance. It including objective function, gradient update and test process.
5. sf_appr_test_all.m is the sparse approximation for all instances.

## Large Attention Matrices
A step-by-step explanation of how to run synthetic experiments code.

## Long Range Arena
Explain how to 
  1) Install the dataset
  2) Preprocess data
  3) Run each experiment
  4) Visualise the attention maps at test time
